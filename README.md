## Display-Case
Display case skript, a recreation of the display block from hypixel skyblock

With the display case, you can only place them on the top side of a block; after that
just shift right-click the empty case with an item to display it
to remove an item, just shift right-click again

to access the GUI, all you have to do is right click the case
to pickup the case, Make sure it has an item, open the GUI, and click the barrier block in the lower left
these cases also have an owner feature, so there is no stealing

Even though this skript is very well made I would recommend against having this skript on servers
with over 40 players, since nbt on projectiles/blocks/entities can be taxing, and there is the possibility of dupes (not that I have found any)

## Installation guide:

First make sure you have the skript version:
skript 2.7-beta 3

(note: this skript has only been tested on 2.7 beta 3/1.19.4)

then create a new file ending in .sk in your scripts folder
then copy paste the skript into the folder, save, and type /sk reload <filename>.sk
in game
